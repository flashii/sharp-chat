# Sock Chat Protocol Information
The protocol operates on a websocket in text mode. Messages sent between the client and server are a series of concatenated strings delimited by the vertical tab character, represented in most languages by the escape sequence `\t` and defined in ASCII as `0x09`.
The first string in this concatenation must be the packet identifier, sent as an integer. The packet identifiers are as follows.

Some instructions are specific to newer revisions of the protocol and some instructions behave differently in newer revisions, all versions are documented but it is recommended you use the latest one. If a packet is marked as deprecated and you only aim to implement the latest version, you may omit it in your implementation as it will never be sent.

The current stable version of the protocol is **Version 1**.

## Client
These are the packets sent from the client to the server.

### Packet `0`: Ping
Used to prevent the client from closing the session due to inactivity.

    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>Timestamp, documented below</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>User ID</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Packet `1`: Authentication
Takes a variable number of parameters that are fed into the authentication script associated with the chat.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>...any</code></td>
        <td>Any amount of data required to complete authentication</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Packet `2`: Message
Informs the server that the user has sent a message.

Required commands for Version 1 are described lower in the document.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>string</code></td>
        <td>Channel name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>...string</code></td>
        <td>Message text, additional packet parameters should be glued on the server using <code>\t</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>User ID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>...string</code></td>
        <td>Message text, additional packet parameters should be glued on the server using <code>\t</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Packet `3`: Upgrade
Informs the server that this client supports a newer version of the protocol. This should always be the first thing you send if you want to upgrade the connection, if any other packet is sent beforehand, this one will be ignored and the session will operate in version 1 mode. An upgrade packet containing any version below 2 should be ignored.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>Version number</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Packet `4`: Typing
Informs the server that this client is writing a message.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>string</code></td>
        <td>Channel name</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Server
These are the packets sent from the server to the client.

### Packet `0`: Pong
Response to client packet `0`: Ping.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>Timestamp, documented below when the packet was handled by the server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Version 1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>string</code></td>
        <td>The literal string <code>pong</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Packet `1`: Join/Auth
While authenticated this packet indicates that a new user has joined the server/channel. Before authentication this packet serves as a response to client packet `1`: Authentication.

This packet behaves differently between version 1 and 2: In version 1 this packet is only sent to the channel that the user is about to join, in version 2 this packet is sent server wide.

#### Successful authentication response
Informs the client that authentication has succeeded.

### Packet `11`: Upgrade acknowledgement
Responds to the client about its upgrade request through Packet `3`: Upgrade.

The client must continue to operate as if it's talking to a Version 1 server until this packet is received. This requirement does hold Packet `1`: Authentication in a strangehold, but luckily there's no reason to alter that packet at all due to its whatever nature.

### Packet `12`: Typing
Informs the client that one or more users are typing.

### Packet `13`: Flood protection warning
Informs the client that they might be kicked soon for flood protection. This packet has no arguments.

## Timestamps

Timestamps in Sock Chat are seconds elapsed since a certain date. Starting with Sock Chat V2 the epoch for the timestamps is different. Under Sock Chat V1 timestamps are regular Unix Epoch timestamps where `0` is `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`. Starting with Sock Chat V2 the epoch has been moved to `2019-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`. In order to convert a Sock Chat V2 timestamp to a Unix timestamp add `1546300800` to it. Sock Chat V2 will realistically never serve messages that predate 2019.

## User Permission String
The User Permission String consists out of five (5) parts concatenated by a space operator, indentified in most languages as the escape sequence <code> </code> and defined as the ASCII character `0x20`.
In the original specification it appeared as if custom permission flags were possible, these have always gone completely unused and should thus be avoided.
The parts are as follows:

- An integer indicating the hierarchy of the user, this is used to determine whether a user has access to certain channels or is able to act out moderator actions upon certain users (lower can't affect higher).
- A boolean indicating whether the user has the ability to kick people.
- A boolean indicating whether the user has access to the logs, this should be zero unless the client has direct access to the message history without a connection the actual chat.
- A boolean indicating whether the user is able to change their nick/display name.
- An integer ranging from 0 to 2 indicating whether the user can create channels
    - `0`: User cannot create channels.
    - `1`: User can create channels, but only temporary ones. These _usually_ disappear after the last user left.
    - `2`: User can create permanent channels.

## Message Flags
Starting with Version 2, the old message flags have been replaced with a bitset describing message attributes rather than directly describing the appearance of the username.

| Bit    | Name      | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- |
| `0x01` | Action    | This message describes an action. (`/me`) |
| `0x02` | Broadcast | This message is a broadcast sent to all users in all channels. **DRAFT NOTE**: Broadcasted messages are also sent to pseudo-channel `@broadcast` so this attribute might be pointless. |
| `0x04` | Log       | This message is a log sent to only a single user. **DRAFT NOTE**: Log messages are also sent to the pseudo-channel `@log` so this attribute might be pointless as well. |
| `0x08` | Private   | This message is privately sent directly from one use to another. |

### Message Flags in Version 1
The Message Flags alter how a message should be displayed to the client, these are all boolean values.
I'm not entirely sure if these allowed for custom flags, but much like the custom flags in the User Permission String, these have gone unused and should thus, also, be avoided.
The parts are as follows:

- Username should appear using a **bold** font.
- Username should appear using a *cursive* font.
- Username should appear __underlined__.
- A colon `:` should be displayed between the username and the message.
- The message was sent privately, directly to the current user.

As an example, the most common message flagset is `10010`.

## Packed color format
Starting with Version 2 colors are no longer sent as textual CSS colors, rather they're sent as a more easy to work with integer format.

The format is pretty simple and comes in the form of a signed 32-bit integer in the following format: `0xFFRRGGBB`.
`FF` is reserved for flags, although the highest bit goes unused as to avoid clashing with the sign bit.
`RR` is the byte containing the red color value, `GG` contains green and `BB` contains blue.

The only flag thusfar is `0x40` for indicating that the parent color should be inherited and the included color bytes should be ignored.

Here's some C code showing an example of converting the integer color to a CSS color string;
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define FLAG_INHERIT (0x40000000)

char* color_to_css(int raw) {
    if(raw & FLAG_INHERIT)
        return "inherit";

    char* css = malloc(17);

    sprintf(
        css,
        "rgb(%d,%d,%d)",
        (raw >> 16) & 0xFF,
        (raw >>  8) & 0xFF,
         raw        & 0xFF
    );

    return css;
}
```
