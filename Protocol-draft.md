# Sock Chat Protocol Information
The protocol operates on a websocket in text mode. Messages sent between the client and server are a series of concatenated strings delimited by the vertical tab character, represented in most languages by the escape sequence `\t` and defined in ASCII as `0x09`.
The first string in this concatenation must be the packet identifier, sent as an `int`.

Newer versions of the protocol are implemented as extensions, a client for Version 1 should have no trouble using a server built for Version 2 as long as authentication is understood.

The current stable version of the protocol is **Version 1**.

## Types

### `bool`
A value that indicates a true or a false state. `0` represents false and anything non-`0` represents true, please stick to `1` for representing true though.

### `int`
Any number ranging from `-9007199254740991` to `9007199254740991`, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` in JavaScript.

### `string`
Any printable unicode character, except `\t` which is used to separate packets.

### `timestamp`
Extends `int`, contains a second based UNIX timestamp.

### `channel name`
A `string` containing only alphanumeric characters (any case), `-` or `_`.

### `session id`
A `string` containing only alphanumeric characters (any case), `-` or `_`.

### `color`
Any valid value for the CSS `color` property.
Further documentation can be found [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).

### `message flags`
Message flags alter how a message should be displayed to the client, these are all `bool` values.
The parts are as follows:

 - Username should appear using a **bold** font.
 - Username should appear using a *cursive* font.
 - Username should appear __underlined__.
 - A colon `:` should be displayed between the username and the message.
 - The message was sent privately, directly to the current user.

As an example, the most common message flagset is `10010`. This indicates a bold username with a colon separator.

### `user permissions`
User permissions are a set of flags separated by either the form feed character (`\f` / `0x0C`) or a space (<code> </code> / `0x20`).
The reason there are two options is due to a past mixup that we now have to live with.
Which of the methods is used remains consistent per server however, so the result of a test can be cached.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><code>int</code></td>
        <td>Rank of the user. Used to determine what channels a user can access or what other users the user can moderate.</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>

## Client Packets
These are the packets sent from the client to the server.

### Packet `0`: Ping

        <td>Added in version 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Packet `1`: Authentication
Takes a variable number of parameters that are fed into the authentication script associated with the chat.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><code>...string</code></td>
        <td>Any amount of data required to complete authentication</td>
        <td></td>
